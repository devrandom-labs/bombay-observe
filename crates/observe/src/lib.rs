/// - The outcome cell is read only after observing COMPLETED via an

/// - The outcome cell is dropped exactly once: by `reset` (a pooled slot has
///   no observers), by the slot's final drop, or transferred by a unique take
///   (which clears `OUTCOME_VALID`, so the slot's final drop skips it).
/// - The `HAS_WAITER` bit and the `COMPLETED` bit share one word, so the two
///   RMWs are totally ordered by the modification order: a waiter that
///   completes its registration never parks without either seeing `COMPLETED`
///   on its post-push recheck or receiving an unpark token from the drain.
